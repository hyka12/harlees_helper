#arithmatic operations are very similar to math ouside of code
#but some things are a little different

x = 10

#these are all the arithmatic operation in python

x = x + 5 #addition obvi

x = x - 2 #subtraction obvi 

x = x * 7 #multiplication obvi

x = x / 2 #division obvi

x = x % 2 #modulo, this divides the number left of it by the number on its right, 
          #if there is a remainder it returns true, if not false 

x = x ** 3 #exponent obvi

x = x // 4 # floor divison, divides and rounds to nearest whole number

#this doesnt print anything, so there is no reason to run it
